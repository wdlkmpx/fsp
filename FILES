   bsd_src/        Directory containing additional sources derived from
                   those in public archive on uunet.uu.net. Most sources

    cmp.c          BSD compare routines.
    find.c         Source for BSD find.
    fnmatch.c      filename matching functions for BSD find.
    function.c     BSD find function parser.
    glob.c         modified BSD globbing routine.
    ls.c           Modified ls source.
    operator.c     operator parsing code for BSD find.
    option.c       option parsing for BSD find.
    print.c        Directory print routines, modified for VMS.
    random.c       BSD random/srandom functions.
    util.c         additional util routines for ls.

   client/         Code common to all clients
    lib.c          Core routines of the client library.
    lock.c         Simple file locking code to do client multi-plexing.
    util.c         Supplementry routines of the client library.

   clients/        Code for the standalone and merged client versions
    fgrabcmd.c     environment variables (fcdcmd and fhostcmd)
    fcatcmd.c      These compiles into individual client utilities.
    fcdcmd.c       Those with a "cmd" in their name will require
    fducmd.c       shell alias wrappers either because they do their own
    ffindcmd.c     file globbing on argv based on directory information
    fgetcmd.c      gotten from the server or because the modify the
    fspprof.l      lex rules for generating fsp_prof parser
    fprintpro.c    display protections flags in human readable form 
    merge.c        This file is used to call the other client programs
	           when program merging option is used.  Rather than
		   compiling into individual client utility programs
