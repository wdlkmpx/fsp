	This document is a major rewrite of the old 
	<ulink url="http://fsp.sourceforge.net/doc/faq.html">FSP FAQ</ulink>.
	I started with this FAQ from scratch cause nearly all parts of the old FAQ where outdated. This new FAQ is maintained
	in DocBook SGML. Send patches to the fsp-devel Mailinglist (FIXME link to id gethelpml) or directly to me
	<email>sven@du-gehoerst-mir.de-nospam</email>. You should be able to find the latest SGML version of this FAQ in the 
	<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=93841">fsp CVS at sf.net</ulink> or here
	<ulink url="http://sven.stormbind.net/fsp/fsp-doc/fsp-faq.sgml">http://sven.stormbind.net/fsp/fsp-doc/fsp-faq.sgml</ulink>
	(be aware the sf.net public CVS is often about a week behind the "real" CVS :( )

      <title>What is FSP?</title>
      <para>
	FSP stands for &fsp;. In general FSP is what anonymous ftp should be, a fast and bandwith friendly
	way to access publicly avaible data. FSP is UDP based so it doesn't have all the protocol overhead you've with TCP
	based transfer protocols. You can find the latest protocol definition right here
	<ulink url="http://fsp.sourceforge.net/doc/PROTOCOL.txt">http://fsp.sourceforge.net/doc/PROTOCOL.txt</ulink>
	or in the source distribution in the "doc" subdirectory.
      </para>

      <para>
	In the past various people maintained the FSP code base. At the moment Radim Kolar <email>hsn@cybermail.net-nospam</email>
	is maintaining FSP. If you like to get involved take a look at the FSP
	<ulink url="http://fsp.sourceforge.net">Homepage</ulink> and the 
	<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/fsp/">FSP project page</ulink>.

      <title>Why and for what should I use FSP?</title>
      <para>
	The &fsp; has its strengths on slow lines and connections with a high package lose like a Wireless LAN. In general the &fsp; is
	what anonymous FTP should be - a fast and bandwith friendly way for anonymous file access.
