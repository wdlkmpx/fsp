FSP SUITE TO DO LIST BY RADIM KOLAR 
/* maintained by hsn -at- netmag * cz */

Radim Kolar's personal wishlist from 1997
show loosers online (finfo command) and server statz
rename command
password change command

TESTSUITE NEEDED:
Write a simple FSP protocol testing tool
Write a test suite using testing tool
test for remote buffer overflows
Test if >2GB files but <4GB works correctly with and without --disable-largefile
Test new command rename /when implemented/

SECURITY BUGS:
symlink to FILE can escape from FSP root directory. OLD known problem.

PROTOCOL-RELATED BUGS:
none known

PORTING
Sven's Slowaris 8 compile problem
not builds on freebsd 4 and non intel platforms?

NEEDS IMPROVMENT:

Client LIBRARY
:high:
local bind address FSP_LOCALIP
we should retune retry algoritm for better support lines with higher
  packed loss.
add more detailed stats from retry alg.  
:low:
fver and others add support new syntax fsp://host:port/file
add sem locking method, possible?
flscmd does stat before directory listing, why?
:long-term goals:
:better to write a new code instead fixing old crap
=convert to multi threaded=
make setup from env a separate function
do not use global variables

CLIENTS 
ALL: normalize return error codes of all clients
write new clients for new commands - fsprencmd fpasswd finfo
:low:
add support for more sane fsplist file format (as used by warez
ppl) to fhostcmd
it looks like
#FSP Sites list
genie.lut.ac.uk        21   genie    / # small UK site

clients do not freeing memory allocated from glob()

FUTURE FEATURES FOR SERVER:
:high: required for 2.8.2 final
can be run multiple times on the same port, how to check? 
  Currently looks fine on bsd.
write RENAME FSP command
bind-ip-address for server (and client via FSP_LOCAL_IP)
report number of clients connected, size of hostable in new command
 CC_INFO command
special defence against rapid/double fire clients (burst command in fspclient)

:midle:may not be in 2.8.2
Native Supports for symbolic links (needed for mirroring Debian)
write FSP_CHANGE_PASSWORD command

:low:this will sure go after 2.8.2:
FSP_GET/SET OWNERS like file transfer
hashed passwords
add switch for dir vs global access priority, override table
use ntons a podobne funkce v iprange.c
pouzivat nejaky jiny typ nez unsigned long pro ip adresu
hard coded directory access rights in configuration instead of loading from FS
support for user directory namespace ~hsn / public_html, check links to outside!
privileged Hosts, excluded from Byte transfer Limit (hard to do)
FSP Proxy repeater

PERFORMANCE:
host hashtable shrinking sometimes
stat cache pro FSP_STAT a ostatni
background time() alarm() caller 
Current performance 1925648B/s

MAN:
update FAQ - urgent!!
separate manpage for 7 fsp (protocol definition) == write FSP RFC

libraries and support for FSP protocol
======================================

DONE: FSP library for Java
DONE: FSP over HTTP
WIP:  new small,light fsplib for C.
FSP backend for APT
FSP plugin do Netscape/MSIE
Transfer HTTP over fsp transport
FSP support to lftp,wget,curl
AVFS plugin http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf

LARGEFILES64 how to turn them on:

Cygwin: #define __LARGE64_FILES fopen64,ftello64,fseeko64 _off64_t
glibc 2.3: #define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE off64_t
native: _FILE_OFFSETS_BITS = 32 / 64 then use off_t
FreeBSD: in 5.X always enabled, in 4.X not supported.
