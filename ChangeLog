Version NEXT
        PROTOCOL updated. Made rules about breaking directory header on
	 packet boundary more clear. Previous text was from fspd code comment
	 and was bad.
	fixed tests/mklargefile.py
	log uploads to wuftpd logfile also
	PROTOCOL file updated. Added required commands section.
	PROTOCOL file updated. Added recommended delay management section.
	default delay in clients adjusted from 1.5 to 1.34 sec as recommended
	 in PROTOCOL
	support for MIN_DELAY, MAX_DELAY and DEFAULT_DELAY in source
	path parsing moved to separate file server/path.c
	new test tool parsecheck
	reworked parse path: separate error messages for high bit chars,
	 control chars
	do not segfault when parsing password protected files. Looks like
	 nobody used password protected files for a long time. This means
	 that in future version of FSP I can change protocol definition
	 without worry about breaking anything
	path with trailing / or starting / is now parsed correctly
	pathes with dot after slash are now detected at parse level (side
	 effect of prev. fix)
	tests moved from server/ into tests/ directory
	removed special test case for root directory in path.c -> use more
	 general alg. instead. This fixed "/" dir.

Version 2.8.1b4 -- 30 March, 2001
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
New maintainer: Radim Kolar hsn/at/cybermail.net now maintains FSP codebase.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1) Eliminated a lot of warnings when compiling with -Wall.
	2) Moved to autoconf 2.12. Replaced old m4 macros with Autoconf's.
	   All autoconf's values are cached.
	3) Makefiles are now generated by automake.
	4) include/tweak.h.in is generated by autoheader.
	5) Added faq.html.
	6) Server now writes more messages when in debug mode. Debug mode is
	   disabled when running in inetd mode. Daemonize is disabled when
	   running in debug mode.
	7) Server accepts command line switches -d (debug) -i (inetd) 
	   -v (version) -p <port> (Alternate port number). Uses now getopt.
	8) Server has now configurable timeouts, maximal packetsize,
	   directory and file handles caches.
	9) REMOVED VMS part vms/ and vms_src/. Is was out of date.
       10) Removed file MACHINES. It was out of date. After my changes in
           autoconf, it may not compile on non-Linux systems.
       11) Implemented a check for reliable signals in the configure script.
       12) Return type of signal handler is detected in configure script.
       13) ANSI prototypes are now used, if host compiler supports them.
       14) When server is running in read-only mode, server send this
           information to clients, instead generic "Permission denied".
       15) Access checking and uploading was fixed. Now works.
